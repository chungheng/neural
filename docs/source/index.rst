Neural
========

Neural is a Python library consisting of implementation of neuron and synapse models with
support of various numerical solvers. Without using a specialized specification language
for neuron or synapse models, PyNeural defines a computational model as a set of ordinary
differential equations in plain Python syntax. For example, a model for computing parabola
trajectory can be expressed as

.. code-block:: python

    >>> class Parabola(Model):
    >>>     ...
    >>>    def ode(self):
    >>>        self.d_x = x
